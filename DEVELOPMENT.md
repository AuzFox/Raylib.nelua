## Summary

**Raylib.nelua** follows original Raylib development cycle with additional features but nothing out of ordinary.

As Raylib updates roll out, **Raylib.nelua** will follow soon after. This binding does not shy away from implementing certain functions to make developers life easier, however. It will never implement new features that would otherwise not fit Raylib. 

## Roadmap

The current roadmap is:

- [ ] Add raygui binding.

## Covered API

- [x] raylib.h
- [x] raymath.h
- [x] easings.h
- [ ] raygui.h
- [x] rlgl.h

## Known Issues

None as of yet.
